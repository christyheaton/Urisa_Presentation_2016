## Steinitz Geodesign Framework
A methodology that provides a design framework and supporting technology to leverage geographic information, resulting in designs that more closely follow natural systems.


## Six key questions used to refine the Geodesign process:

1. How should the study area be described?
2. How does the study area function?
3. Is the current study area working well?
4. How might the study area be altered?
5. What difference might the changes cause?
6. How should the study area be changed?
